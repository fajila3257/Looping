2)Write a program to determine whether 'n' is a factorial number or not. Factorial of a number is the product of all positive numbers from 1 to 'n'.
Input format:
The input containing an integer 'n' which denotes the given number.
Output format:
If the given number is factorial, print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No".
Refer the sample output for formatting.
Sample Input:
6
Sample Output:
Yes
answer:
def is_factorial(n):
    if n < 0:
        return "No"
    factorial = 1
    i = 1
    while factorial < n:
        i += 1
        factorial *= i
    return "Yes" if factorial == n else "No"
n = int(input("Enter an integer n: "))
print(is_factorial(n))
output:
Yes
